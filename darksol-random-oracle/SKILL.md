# DARKSOL Random Oracle

On-chain verifiable randomness for agents, games, raffles, simulations, and apps.

Bankr can use this skill when a user asks for fair random numbers, coin flips, dice rolls, shuffles, giveaway winners, loot outcomes, or any randomness that should be publicly auditable.

## Service

- UI: `https://acp.darksol.net/oracle`
- API base: `https://acp.darksol.net/oracle`
- Chain: Base `8453`
- Oracle contract: `0x4d2f471ae67b129bAda9cfC6224f0343c5C8fB5D`
- DARKSOL token: `0x00cb1fbca324d51325a7264d54072bc073c28ba3`
- x402 payment token: USDC on Base `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`
- x402 pay-to: `0x8f9fa2bfd50079c1767d63effbfe642216bfcb01`

## When To Use

Use this skill for:

- coin flips
- dice rolls
- random integers
- random sequences
- shuffling a list
- raffle or giveaway winner selection
- loot tables and game outcomes
- simulation seeds
- casino/game mechanics that need verifiable RNG
- agent workflows that need proof-backed randomness with a Base transaction receipt

Do not use this skill for private key generation, wallet seed generation, passwords, cryptographic nonces, or secrets. The oracle returns public verifiable randomness, not private entropy.

## Access Model

### DARKSOL Holder Free Access

If the caller controls a wallet holding at least `10,000,000 DARKSOL` on Base, calls are free.

The caller signs this exact message, replacing the wallet address:

```text
DARKSOL Oracle free access
Wallet: 0xYourAgentWallet
Chain: Base (8453)
Purpose: prove token-holder access without payment
```

Send the proof headers:

```http
x-darksol-wallet: 0xYourAgentWallet
x-darksol-signature: 0xSignature
```

### x402 Paid Access

Without a valid holder proof, oracle endpoints require x402 payment:

- basic endpoints: `$0.05` USDC on Base
- premium endpoints: `$0.25` USDC on Base

A normal unauthenticated request returns HTTP 402 with payment requirements. Pay using an x402-compatible client, then retry with the x402 payment header.

## Endpoints

### Health

```http
GET https://acp.darksol.net/oracle/health
```

Returns health, contract, block number, pricing, and free-access details.

### Random Number

```http
GET https://acp.darksol.net/oracle/random/number?min=1&max=100
```

Params:
- `min`: integer, default `1`
- `max`: integer, default `10`

Price: `$0.05` or free for eligible DARKSOL holders.

### Coin Flip

```http
GET https://acp.darksol.net/oracle/random/coin
```

Returns `heads` or `tails`.

Price: `$0.05` or free for eligible DARKSOL holders.

### Dice Roll

```http
GET https://acp.darksol.net/oracle/random/dice?sides=20&count=3
```

Params:
- `sides`: integer `2..1000`, default `6`
- `count`: integer `1..100`, default `2`

Price: `$0.05` or free for eligible DARKSOL holders.

### Random Sequence

```http
GET https://acp.darksol.net/oracle/random/sequence?count=6&min=1&max=49
```

Params:
- `count`: integer `1..100`, default `5`
- `min`: integer, default `1`
- `max`: integer, default `50`

Price: `$0.25` or free for eligible DARKSOL holders.

### Shuffle

```http
GET https://acp.darksol.net/oracle/random/shuffle?items=alice,bob,carol,dave
```

Params:
- `items`: comma-separated list with at least 2 items

Price: `$0.25` or free for eligible DARKSOL holders.

## Response Shape

```json
{
  "result": 77,
  "access": {
    "mode": "x402_settled",
    "paymentRequired": true
  },
  "proof": {
    "txHash": "0x...",
    "blockNumber": 45168397,
    "contract": "0x4d2f471ae67b129bAda9cfC6224f0343c5C8fB5D",
    "chain": "base",
    "chainId": 8453
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-04-25T14:09:01.905Z"
}
```

Always surface the `proof.txHash` when reporting results to a user. That is the audit trail.

If the endpoint returns HTTP `202` with `status: "pending"`, payment has settled but oracle confirmation exceeded the request window. Surface `access.payment.transaction` as the payment proof and `pending.txHash` as the oracle tx to check/retry shortly. Do **not** submit another payment just because the oracle response is pending.

## Bankr Prompt Examples

```text
Use DARKSOL Random Oracle to roll 3 d20 dice and show me the Base proof tx.
```

```text
Use DARKSOL Random Oracle to pick a giveaway winner from alice,bob,carol,dave. Return the shuffled list and proof hash.
```

```text
Use DARKSOL Random Oracle to generate 6 lottery numbers from 1 to 49 and include the on-chain verification link.
```

```text
Flip a verifiable coin using DARKSOL Random Oracle.
```

## Agent Procedure

1. Parse the user request into one endpoint and query params.
2. Prefer holder-free access if the user provides a wallet and signature.
3. Otherwise use x402 USDC payment on Base.
4. Call the endpoint.
5. Return the result plus the proof transaction link:
   `https://basescan.org/tx/<txHash>`
6. If the endpoint returns HTTP 402, complete the x402 payment flow and retry.
7. If the endpoint returns HTTP 202/status pending, report the payment tx and pending oracle tx; do not pay again.

## Curl Examples

```bash
curl https://acp.darksol.net/oracle/health
```

```bash
curl "https://acp.darksol.net/oracle/random/number?min=1&max=100"
```

```bash
curl "https://acp.darksol.net/oracle/random/dice?sides=20&count=3"
```

```bash
curl "https://acp.darksol.net/oracle/random/shuffle?items=alice,bob,carol,dave"
```

## Safety Notes

- Results are public and verifiable. Do not use for secrets.
- For regulated gambling, check jurisdictional requirements before use.
- For fairness-sensitive apps, store the returned proof tx with the application record.
